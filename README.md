## Mailerlite UI-redesign
This is a website redesign of the hero section  

### Description
For the MailerLite Hero Section redesign, the goal was to create a visually compelling and user-friendly introduction that effectively communicates the product's value. Using Figma, I redesigned the hero section with a clean, modern layout, incorporating a bold headline, engaging visuals, and a clear call-to-action button. The design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, ensuring users can quickly grasp the product's benefits.

Once the design was finalized, I translated it into code using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for rapid styling. Tailwind allowed for efficient utility-first development, ensuring pixel-perfect responsiveness across devices. The final implementation retained the original design's aesthetic, while optimizing load times and ensuring accessibility.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
